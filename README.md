# Car-Insurance-Approval-Prediction

<p align="justify">
This project aims to develop a predictive model that forecasts the approval status of car insurance applications based on various factors related to the car's condition. By leveraging advanced supervised learning algorithms, the model will enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the decision-making process, reducing the likelihood of errors and eliminating the need for human intervention. The project utilizes several machine learning algorithms, including **Cat Boost**, **AdaBoost**, **Gradient Boosting**, **Multi-Layer Perceptron**, and **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**, to ensure the highest accuracy in predicting whether an applicant will be approved for car insurance.
